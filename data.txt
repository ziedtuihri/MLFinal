Context 
============================

    The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.

Content
=======================

This dataset includes important attributes of the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts.

Variable Information
===================================

01	date			:	Date in MM-DD-YYYY
02	day			:	Day of the Week
03	quarter			:	A portion of the month. A month was divided into four quarters
04	department		:	Associated department with the instance
05	team_no			:	Associated team number with the instance
06	no_of_workers		:	Number of workers in each team
07	no_of_style_change	:	Number of changes in the style of a particular product
08	targeted_productivity	:	Targeted productivity set by the Authority for each team for each day.
09	smv			:	Standard Minute Value, it is the allocated time for a task
10	wip			:	Work in progress. Includes the number of unfinished items for products
11	over_time		:	Represents the amount of overtime by each team in minutes
12	incentive		:	Represents the amount of financial incentive (in BDT) that enables or motivates a particular course of action.
13	idle_time		:	The amount of time when the production was interrupted due to several reasons
14	idle_men		:	The number of workers who were idle due to production interruption
15	actual_productivity	:	The actual % of productivity that was delivered by the workers. It ranges from 0-1.

Associated tasks
=========================================
The objective of this project is to:
* Clean the dataset
* Perform data clustering by comparing the performance of different algorithms (Kmeans, CAH, DBSCAN, GMM, etc.)
* Regression using ensemble methods (Bagging & boosting): Predication of the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.
* Develop a website using the technology of your choice (Django, Flask, FastAPI, ...) that enables making predictions using the selected optimal model.
